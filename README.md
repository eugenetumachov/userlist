A simple Nextjs CRUD app for managing a collection of users.

## Done / not done:

- [x] list users
- [x] pagination
- [x] create user
- [x] delete user
- [x] update user
- [x] FE validation: make all fields required
- [x] filter by name
- [ ] AI feature - couldn't make it within the timeframe :(

possible additions and improvements:

- [ ] tests!
- [ ] use zod for schema based validation
- [ ] table page resets after refetch
- [ ] localization
- [ ] server-side validation (payload json, if user id exists, valid email, phone, etc.)
- [ ] use Form from shadcn
- [ ] UI: responsive design
- [ ] UI: show more specific info (user name) in deletion alert
- [ ] UI: advanced pagination
- [ ] UI: filter input: add a clear button
- [ ] use a DB
