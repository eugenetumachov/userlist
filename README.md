# Objectives:

Develop an application that allows a user to view, add, update, and delete users
from a list.

The estimated time for this task is a maximum of 4 hours. When you reach it, letâ€™s have a call regardless of the features you delivered. 

The idea is to have a practical conversation about your craftsmanship, such as technological choices, engineering excellence, mindset, and approach. 

Consider it as a Pull request review.

# Requirements:

In general: consider quality code, architecture, and overall engineering standards that are appropriate and sound for you.

## List Users:

- Display a list of users with their Name, Email, and Phone number.
- Implement pagination.
- Each user should have a 'Delete' button next to their details.

## Add/Update/Delete User:

- Provide a form to manage users with fields for Name, Email, and
Phone number.
- Validate that all fields are filled before submitting.

## Error Handling:

- Display user-friendly error messages if the API calls fail.

## Bonus Tasks:

- Add a search bar to filter through the user list based on their names.
- Implement & enhance it with AI of your choosing
    - examples: AI-generated avatars, chatbot help with the user context, smarter search with ChatGPT integration, etc.)
